    <h1>Supporting and Guiding Children in Grief</h1>
    <p>It is a misconception to assume that children do not experience grief or are unaware of death because of their age or inexperienced level of development.
    Although the concept and process of loss and grief may be confusing to a child, it is not advisible to try and protech him or her from any pain or upset they may
    experience as a result, but instead foster a space where you allow them to process and express their emotions in healthy ways. Because of lack of emotional maturity
    and understanding, a chld experiencing loss or grief should be guided and supported through their journey by a trusted adult and/or professional experienced in the field.
    </p>
    <h4>Children grieve differently</h4>
    <p>It is common for children experienceing loss to swing through emotions more rapidly and often than adults. Similar to adults, how a child grieves will depend on
        a number of varying factors, but one of the most impoortant to take into consideration is developmental age.
        Follow <a href="https://www.tiporangecounty.org/pdfs/How_to_help_chart.pdf" target="_blank">this link</a> for information on age appropriate grief support for kids.
        Young children may tend to model their behaviors and actions to fit those of the grieving adults around them. This is not a reason to hide grief from a child, instead it is
        an opportunity to open the door for discussion and expression around different topics pertaining to grief and loss (always striving to use simple and age appropriate language).
