        <h2 class="headers">What is grief?</h2>
            <div class="plain-text">
                <p><h4>"Grief is the set of experiences that involves the perceived loss that someone has around a person, a situation, an event,
                    a happening that changes the way [a person] physically, emotionally, spiritually reacts and responds to the world around them. - Alesia Alexander, LCSW"</h4>
                    Grief is a natural response to loss. Each person's journey with grief is unique and is shaped by a multitude of factors
                    including but not limited to: culture, religious & spiritual beliefs, past experiences with loss, personality traits and network(s) of support.
                    An important factor to remember when understanding and exploring grief is that it is not limited to only the expereience of physical death. We
                    can grieve the loss of a job, the ending of a relationship, the loss of health or the loss of safety and security. The foundation of grief is rooted
                    in an individual's "perceived" loss and therefore can arise as a result from a variety of situations and expereinces.

        <h2 class="headers">No rules in grief</h2>
            <div class="plain-text">
                <p>There is no "wrong" or "right" way to grieve. A person may grieve outwardly by talking about their loss with others, while another person may work through
                    their grief in private and through personal practices. In addition to there being no right or wrong ways to grieve, there is also no perfect
                    or clearly defined steps, roadmap or timeline to follow when on the journey. Grief has no definite ending point like a finish line at the end of a marathon.
                    It is more often like an infinite roller coaster ride filled with counteless peaks and dips of breakthroughs and breakdowns with unexpected turns and loops
                    of triggers and resolutions, where the gut wrentching feelings of fear and hopelessness can transform into adrenaline and courageouness of the unknown
                    possibilities of all that lies ahead.</p>
            </div>

        <h2 class="headers">Secondary Loss</h2>
            <div class="plain-text">
                <p>Grief is usually initiated by the perceived initial loss, which may be called a "primary loss". But many times people often overlook the
                    weight of secondary loss, which is the subsequent losses that are a result of the inital loss. For example if a child's parent dies they will not
                    only be impacted by the death of that parent (primary loss) but they may also experience the losses of financial security, confidence, dreams and wishes
                    for their future, faith, their support system etc. (secondary losses).
